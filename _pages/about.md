I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in **Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University**, advised by [Professor Xubo Yue](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/maxyxb/). I received my Bachelor's degree in **Mathematics from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University**, where I was advised by [Professor Olivier Pauluis](https://wp.nyu.edu/opauluis/). I obtained my Master’s degree in **Applied Mathematics from Northwestern University**, advised by [Professor Wenxin Jiang](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/wji047/).

## Research Interests

My research interests include causal machine learning (theory, inference, discovery), reinforcement learning, intelligent decision-making systems, and applications in advanced manufacturing.
